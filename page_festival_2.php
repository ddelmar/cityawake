    					<h2>About the Festival</h2>
    					<p>This November, City Awake will unite and empower the Boston community with the second annual City Awake Festival for Social Impact. In bringing together individuals, organizations, and institutions that are invested in the growth of our city and its social impact work, this ten-day, citywide festival provides the platform to increase awareness and maximize impact of the efforts and initiatives of the for-impact community. Similar to the inaugural year, the pulse of the 2015 festival will depend upon our hundreds of existing and new partner organizations, while also featuring new elements that highlight the outcomes – and drivers – of City Awake’s 2015 programmatic initiatives.</p>
                        <br />

                        <p>True to its form, this festival is a genuine grass-roots effort and illustrates the capabilities of our united community: events, which will vary in topic, format, and location, with many happening simultaneously across the city, will be open to the public and designed, implemented, and hosted by the dedicated partners. While it is a celebration of the achievements of the entire for-impact community, the festival also marks the chance for reflection and future planning. Join us in solidifying Boston’s position as an impact ecosystem hub: one that leverages its constituents’ diverse expertise & networks to tackle the world’s most challenging problems.
                        </p>
