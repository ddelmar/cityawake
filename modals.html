	<h2>City Awake’s Coalition and Festival Partners</h2>
	<p>
		The City Awake Coalition is comprised of nearly 250 social impact organizations, from non-profits and innovative social enterprises to academic institutions. We convene and collaborate with them to make Boston a global hub for social impact. Most of our coalition members are running events during the 2015 Festival, although it’s not required. If your organization is interested in participating in the Festival but has not joined the coalition yet, we invite you to do so (we’ve made it easy with a 2-in-1 registration form below).

		Organize an event. Your organization will lead the planning of an impact-focused event that takes place within the Festival window (November 5-14). It can be as simple as a happy hour or ambitious as a summit. It's entirely up to you. Were you already planning an event in November? It must be fate! </p><br />

No problem, we love when organizations collaborate! The City Awake team will do it’s best to match your organization will another one that is also interested in collaboration. Just use the same registration form below to get started.

	<h2>Charging Admission for Your Event</h2>
	<p>
		We realize running an event has costs, in time, resources, and staff, and we absolutely do not want participation in the festival to be a burden upon any organization. With that in mind, if offering free admission to your event is not possible, we encourage organizations to consider charging a modest fee to cover operational costs, in an effort to make the festival as a whole accessible to all!
