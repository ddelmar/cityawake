	<h2>City Awake’s Coalition and Festival Partners</h2>
	<p>
		The City Awake Coalition is comprised of nearly 250 social impact organizations, from non-profits and innovative social enterprises to academic institutions. We convene and collaborate with them to make Boston a global hub for social impact. Most of our coalition members are running events during the 2015 Festival, although it’s not required. If your organization is interested in participating in the Festival but has not joined the coalition yet, we invite you to do so (we’ve made it easy with a 2-in-1 registration form below).

	<h2>How Your Oganization Can Participate</h2>
	<p>
		Organize an event. Your organization will lead the planning of an impact-focused event that takes place within the Festival window (November 5-14). It can be as simple as a happy hour or ambitious as a summit. It's entirely up to you. Were you already planning an event in November? It must be fate! </p><br />

		<p>Collaborate on an event. Don’t feel like you have the capacity to design an event on your own? Or maybe you have an idea but aren’t sure how to move it forward? No problem, we love when organizations collaborate! The City Awake team will do it’s best to match your organization will another one that is also interested in collaboration. Just use the same registration form below to get started. 
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Provide in-kind support. We get it; organizing an event is a lot of work! So if that’s not an option for you this year, don’t fret, there are other ways to get involved! We’re always grateful to accept in-kind donations to the festival and events, from providing venue space or catering for an event, to lending your professional expertise. </p>

<div id="chargingmodal">
	<h2>Charging Admission for Your Event</h2>
	<p>
		We realize running an event has costs, in time, resources, and staff, and we absolutely do not want participation in the festival to be a burden upon any organization. With that in mind, if offering free admission to your event is not possible, we encourage organizations to consider charging a modest fee to cover operational costs, in an effort to make the festival as a whole accessible to all!
